***** Intro *****
The class of InterCode(IC) is a list of statements.
There are 3 classes derived from class STATEMENT: COMMAND, LOOP, EXPRESSION.
Basic commands are implemented in class COMMAND.
If block and while loops are implmented in class LOOP. This class contains a pointer to a internal IC object.
For-loop has its own class derived from LOOP.
IO redirection and global variable settings are done in each command ITSELF!!
Logical expressions are done in class EXPRESSION. A single basic atom sentence is implemented in class EXPRESSIONATOM.

The statements are connected by a list of pointers, each pointing to one statement.
Statements are created seperatly by the PARSER layer and maintained by its IC container. Mermory should be freed only by class IC.
Memory should always be allocated by The Parser; memory should always be freed by its container.

These classes should always be created by pointers.
