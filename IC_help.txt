The class of IC is a list of commands.
Each command contains 3 parameters (numbers: 0~255).
The first char represents the type of the command.
The second and third are arguments.
There are many different types; currently there are
0 = Loop
1 = Variable
2 = Pipeline
(special operations)...(commands)
32 = ls (command)
... more could be added.

For a command, the first argument is its input, the second the output.
ex: ls -al /home/ --> type = 32, arg1 = "-al /home/", arg2 = SCREEN

For a operation, the arguments are specially designed.
ex. for loop --> arg1 = start/stop, arg2 = identifier.
ex. pipeline --> arg1 = output(first stage), arg2 = input(second stage)
