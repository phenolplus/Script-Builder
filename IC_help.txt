The class of IC is a list of statements.
There are 3 classes derived from class STATEMENT: COMMAND, LOOP, BUILTIN.
Basic commands are implemented in class COMMAND.
For loops and while loops are implmented in class LOOP. This class contains a pointer to a internal IC object.
IO redirection and global variable settings are done by class BUILTIN.

The statements are connected by a list of pointers, each pointing to one statement.
Statements are created seperatly by the PARSER layer and maintained by its IC container. Mermory should be freed only by class IC.

These classes should always be created by pointers.
